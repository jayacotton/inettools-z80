Here are the first hacks at getting some inet like tools running on
CP/M.

I am using (borrowing/stealing) code from several places.  See source for details.

A lot of hacking went into getting the code to run.  Probably some self inflicted
injuries along the way.

The programs of interest are linked by the Make file.

I am using z88dk and the tool chain.

You will need to hunt down and change the mac address in every file
you can find and in some cases a hard coded ip address.
I will get around to fixing this at a latter date.  

make clean; make ; make install  Gets the programs to build
and copies them to /var/www/html/

With this and apache2 you can get wget running from your 
CP/M machine.  

Programs in this build,  Note:  these don't work like there unix 
big brothers.  

	DIG.COM
		C>dig www.google.com                                                            
		WWW.GOOGLE.COM :172.217.6.36     
	IFCONFIG.COM
		C>ifconfig                                                                      
		inet 192.168.1.129 netmask 255.255.255.0                                        
		ether 98.76.b6.11.00.c4      
	MYGET.COM
		c>myget <filename>
		this will copy a file from your local http server at a
		hard coded address.  (you will need to change the address
		for your network).
	PING.COM
		C>ping www.nasa.gov

		-----------PING TEST OK----------                                               
	TELNET.COM
		c>telnet <server name/inet address>
			bla bla bla
		exit (assumes your server does shell exit)
	WGET.COM
		c> wget http://<url or inet address> filename
		copies a file from the server to your CP/M box.

All of these programs are a bit shaky or just plain buggy.  

The socket libraries are kinda broken.  If you are used to BSD sockets you will get into 
trouble real fast.  I am thinking about fixing some of the more obvious bugs and mistakes
...maybe next month...  The main reason to fix these libs, is it then gets easier to port
code to CP/M.

WRT the h/w.

I coded all this to run with my bit banger SPI bus card and an Adafruit wiznet w5500 
ethernet board.  I am planning to build up a h/w SPI board soon, and will make a unified
driver for both cards.  If I can figure out how to do it (correctly) I will be able to
run the programs on ether SPI card with no modification (recompile) needed.  That would
be very nice to do.

Work to be done:

Fix the socket library.
Get some kind of timer code running with the ctc board.
Figure out a good select method.
Unified SPI driver.
Try to get the w5500 driver to work with the w5100 chip.  (it should but wont).
