In this section we have the BOM for the MT011 board as built
for my needs.

For the best and current information about the MT011 board see
https://github.com/markt4311/MT011.git

Find here the mt011-bom.ods a spread sheet for the BOM of the board.
And the schematic (copied from above) MT011_SPI_WIZNET.pdf

I will include a picture of the board as built.

This board is now working on 18mhz cpu rc2014 systems.

There is a small rework to get an access status led for the enet board.
Look at the schmatic, The resistor R2 leg that connects to pin 7
of U3 should be moved to pin 10 of U3.
